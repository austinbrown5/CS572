Some parts may require significant debugging.\n","\n","For this assignment we will use the CoNLL 2003 dataset which contains sentences\n","labeled with 4 types of entities -- PER, ORG, LOC and MISC. We will again filter out rare words and replace them with an `<unk>` token.\n","\n","**Note**: You do **not** need a GPU for this assignment unless, as part of the extension, you implement a neural CRF. If you do decide to use the GPU, please only do so when needed to avoid getting locked out of colab. You can enable / disable GPU usage by changing the Runtime type under the Runtime menu.\n","\n","**Grading Rubric**\n","- 70% results\n"," - 15% `viterbi_vals.npy` (Viterbi correctness)\n"," - 15%

Equivalently, we can view $\\mathbf{f}_{label}$ as just being $\\mathbf{F}_{label}$ dimensional, and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{label}$ as being a $K \\times F_{label}$ matrix. Then $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{label} \\, \\mathbf{f}_{label}$ is a matrix-vector product, which gives us a vector of scores, one for each label.

Thus, interpreted as a matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{trans}$ will have $K^2$ rows, and $F_{trans}$ columns. To keep this matrix small, we use a small number of transition features. In particular, we will use only a subset of those used in $\\mathbf{f}_{label}$.

The following code will create a DataLoader which, when iterated over, returns a `(batchsize x M word indices, batchsize x M label indices)` tuple instead of a `(batchsize x M x F feature indices, batchsize x M label indices)` tuple:\n","\n","  ```\n","  train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trdata, batch_size=1,\n","       batch_sampler=ByLengthSampler(trdata, 'tokens', batchsize, shuffle=True),\n","       collate_fn=collate)\n","     ```\n","\n","Note that a significant part of the the test set consists of examples from a different domain.
