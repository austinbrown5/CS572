# CS572
This file contains my work from CS572 - Natural Language Processing. It is broken into 4 large assignments in which I was tasked with creating different models from scratch. 

Assignment 1: N-gram Model, Neural N-gram Model, GRU \\
Assignment 2: Hidden Markov Model + Viterbi Algorithm, Conditional Random Field + Forward Algorithm \\
Assignment 3: LSTM seq2seq Decoder with Luong Attention, Beam Search \\
Assignment 4: TF - IDF Sparse Retriever, Dense Retriever (Finetuned BERT)
